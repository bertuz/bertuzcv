## <a name="intro"></a> Lightweight Modern Curriculum Vitae Template

**bertuz CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**. It has been written
in order to keep a very clean and semantic LaTeX source. Changes to your Résumé
should should be quick to do and the source should keep easy to read information right into your source file.

The layout has been designed by me from scratch in order to suit my needs, but further contributions are more than welcome and encouraged.

## <a name="improvements">improvements
**A lot** of improvements can be done. This is my very first class in LaTeX and
it will be improved according to my free time. The next improvements will be:

- Try to compile it in XeLaTeX
- Include Lato font (no system installation required)
- Include FontAwesome (no system installation required)
- Make the photo filename a parameter
- I18n

## <a name="how-to-use">How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437). The class has been designed and developed
to work with LuaLaTeX, but XeLaTeX should work too (or with little modifications).
I recommend to compile your source with LuaLaTeX.

[Lato font](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) is required, but I will include it in the future versions.

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ lualatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
